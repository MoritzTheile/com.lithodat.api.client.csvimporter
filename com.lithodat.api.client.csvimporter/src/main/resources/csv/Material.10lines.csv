1,Abelsonite,"Chemically a nickel porphyrine derivative, classified as <strong>deoxophylloerythroetioporphyrin</strong>. Unique combination of elements; the only organonickel mineral known. Formed at depth (Milton et al., 1978), likely from a chlorophyll (but likely not the chlorophyll-d) (Storm et al., 1984).

Abelsonite is accompanied by its structural norisomer; the surrounding shale contains other Ni porphyrins, which represent a series of more extended homologues.

Structure details (Storm et al., 1984): (1) methyl groups in the 2, 3, 7, 12, and 18 positions, (2) ethyl group in the 8 and 17 positions. According to Milton et al.(1978) the molecules in abelsonite are not planar. The substitution pattern in the mineral is genetically related to a typical chlorophyll. The potential precursor to abelsonite is 17-desethyl, 17-propionic acid.

Worth of notice is an unnamed mineral coded as <m>'UM1984-14-CH:ClNOV'</m>, which is a natural vanadyl deoxophylloerythroetioporphyrin, the second known metalloporphyrin mineral, although not isostructural with abelsonite.",0,Ni(C<sub>31</sub>H<sub>32</sub>N<sub>4</sub>),,-Ni-N-C-H-,-Ni-N-C-H-,"Aggregates of platy crystals; as patches, sometimes over 2 mm in diameter",",en,",",fr,it,","Mahogany Zone oil shale; found in six stratigraphical zones ( M9, M7, M2, L6, L0, and K1); its genesis is connected with unique geochemical conditions of Lake Uinta; likely formed due to chlorophyll diagenesis; abelsonite's relatively insoluble precursor was likely transported by an aqueous solution towards sediments of favorable lithology","Small aggregates, to 1 cm, of thin laths or

2,Abenakiite-(Ce),"Unique chemistry (the only Na-REE-Si-P-C mineral). Chemistry comparable to that of <m>steenstrupine-(Ce)</m>.

Currently the only mineral with a supposed sulphur dioxide ligand. 
Originally a single grain was found, making the mineral exceedingly rare. 

Hexagonal net of the structure contains (1) chains of NaO<sub>7</sub> polyhedra connected with phosphate groups, (2) six-membered ring of SiO<sub>4</sub>, NaO<sub>7</sub> and NaO<sub>7</sub>-(REE)O<sub>8</sub> polyhedra, forming columns, (3) carbonate and SO<sub>2</sub> groups, and NaO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, within the columns. In terms of the linkage of six-member silicate ring and NaO<sub>6</sub> octahedron, abenakiite-(Ce) may be compared to <m>kazakovite</m> and steenstrupine-(Ce) (McDonald et al., 1994).

Infrared data for an S-deficient and H<sub>2</sub>O-bearing variety <strong>or a related species</strong> from the Sirenevaya pegmatite is given by Chukanov (2014).
