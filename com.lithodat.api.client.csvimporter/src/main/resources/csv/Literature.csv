Andriessen and Arjan Bos ;Apatite and zircon fission-track ages and biotite Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages in the Eidfjord crustal segment (the Eidfjord Granite and overthrust granitic gneisses) indicate a rapid cooling, from 400°C to 200ºC, between 390 and 306 Ma ago. Then the cooling rate slowed considerably: it took until 166 Ma ago before the crustal level, which is now situated at an altitude of 1620 m, had cooled further to 105°C, while the crustal level which lies now at sea level had cooled to this temperature about 10 Ma ago. Assuming a geothermal gradient of 30°C/km, a mean uplift rate of 0.1 mm/a shortly after the Caledonian orogenesis is calculated for the time-span from about 390 to 306 Ma ago. This rapid uplift is stratigraphically reflected in the deposition of the Old Red Sandstone deposits. For the last 300 Ma or so, until the present, the uplift rate was much slower: of the order of 0.02 mm/a. From the mineral age pattern, it is calculated that since about 390 Ma ago, shortly after the termination of Caledonian oragenesis, over 13, 000 metres of crustal material have been removed by erosion and denudation, of which some 5000 m within the first 80 Ma or so. ;https://njg.geologi.no/vol-61-70/details/19/741-741;66;;029-196X;;;;Andriessen_1986;;Andriessen_1986(Norsk Geologisk Tidsskrift);;

M. Andriessen and Klaus-J. Reutter;K-Ar and fission track mineral age determinations and fission track length measurements were performed on several plutons which together form a cross section along 23°S lat. running from the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile to the Cordillera Oriental of northwestern Argentina. The spectrum of apparent mineral ages of the different plutons, ranging from about 530 to 30 Ma, support the present general ideas about the magmatic and tectonic evolution of this area. A strong relation is seen between the mineral ages and variations of the subduction regime. The plutons intruded at different depths, some of them belong to the Jurassic-early Cretaceous magmatic arc system 10 to 12 km deep, while others of the mid-Cretaceous magmatic arc system and especially those related to the late Cretaceous-Palaeogene magmatic arc systems were emplaced at shallow depths. These plutons were brought to the surface in the final emplacement of the arc systems by tectonic uplift. The mineral ages of Palaeozoic basement rocks, situated farther to the east, show a more complex history with final uplift during Eocene-Oligocene tectonism.;;;;;;;;Andriessen_1994;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;Andriessen_1994(Tectonics of the Southern Central Andes, Springer);10.1007/978-3-642-77353-2_10;
;;;1997;;Thrust Tectonics and Uplift Process of the Nepal Himalaya Revealed from Fission-Track Ages;;2;;;Journal of Geography (Chigaku Zasshi);156--167;;;;;;;;;Kazunori Arita and Yoshihiro Ganzawa;The Himalaya is a fold-and-thrust belt in the northern margin of the Indian continental plate, and a product of the collision between India and Asia since the Eocene. The Himalayan orogen consists of several tectonostratigraphic units bounded by diachronous thrusts younging from north to south, namely, the Kangmar Thrust in southern Tibet, the Main Central Thrust, the Main Boundary Thrust, and the Main Frontal Thrust. These thrust faults are splays off from a major mid-crustal decollement named the Main Detachment Fault or the Main Himalayan Thrust. In he Nepal Himalaya, there is also an out-of-sequence thrust, which cuts across the Main Central Thrust, within the Lesser Himalaya. Abundant geological and geomorphological evidence has suggested that the Himalayan uplift began in the Tethys (or Tibetan) Himalaya, which is situated to the north of the present crest line of the Himalaya (the Higher Himalaya), the uplift then shifted southward, and was finally accelerated in the Higher Himalaya since the Pliocene. Such a migration of the uplift through time is attributed to the southward younging of the activity of above thrusts. Nine zircon fission-track ages from the crystalline rocks of the Higher Himalaya and the Main Central Thrust zone in the Kali Gandaki and Modi Khola valleys, central Nepal, show a linear increase from 1.2Ma to 2.3Ma with increasing elevation. An average denudation rate of 0.9mm/y during this period is thus calculated. Assuming a closing temperature of 260°C for fission-tracks in zircon and a paleo-geothermal gradient of 35°C/ km, averagedenudation rates since the Late Pliocene are over 3mm/y. The denudation rates increase as approach the present, and rearch >6mm/y after 1.2Ma. The trend of linear increase of fission-track ages with increasing elevation is not disturbed by the Main Central Thrust, therefore suggesting the cessation of Main Central Thrust activity in the Late Pli ocene and a flexural uplifting since then, not a differential movement along the Main C entral Thrust. Three zircon fission-track ages from granites of the Kathmadu Nappe located south of the out-of-sequence thrust are about 9Ma, and yield an average denudation rate of 0.8mm/y for the period 9-0Ma. The rapid uplift of the Higher Himalaya in central Nepal since the Late Pliocene may have been due to elastic doming of the Lesser Himalayan rocks beneath the Higher and Lesser Himalayas. The doming has resulted from the fault-bend folding of the rocks along the ramp of the out-of-sequence thrust at depth caused by the northward slippage of the Indian crust along the Main Detachment Fault. ;;106;;;;;;Arita_1997;Tokyo Geographical Society;Arita_1997(Journal of Geography);10.5026/jgeography.106.156;

Patterns and timing of exhumation deduced from low-temperature thermochronology data;;B3;;;Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth;;;;;;;;;;Phillip A. Armstrong and Todd A. Ehlers and David S. Chapman and Kenneth A. Farley and Peter J. J. Kamp;The Wasatch Mountains are often cited as an example of normal fault growth and footwall flexure. They represent a tilted footwall at the edge of the Basin and Range extensional province, a major rift basin. Thus understanding the detailed spatial and elevation changes in coupled thermochronometer data, and how these changes can be interpreted, may aid in the analysis of thermochronometer data from other extensional regions around the world. We present a dense data set from the Cottonwood Intrusive Belt (CIB) of the Wasatch that includes apatite fission track (AFT), zircon fission track (ZFT), and apatite (U‐Th)/He ages. ZFT, AFT, and apatite (U‐Th)/He ages are 10, 5, and 3 Ma, respectively, adjacent to the Wasatch fault. AFT and (U‐Th)/He ages increase slightly with distance east of the fault until about 15–20 km, where a more abrupt increase in these ages occurs at or near the Silver Fork‐Superior fault zone. ZFT and AFT ages are concordant with 31–38 Ma pluton emplacement ages on the eastern side of range. Modeling of the data leads to the following interpretation: (1) Early cooling and ∼3–4 km of exhumation for the middle and eastern parts of the range occurred in the late Oligocene‐middle Miocene. (2) Beginning at 10–12 Ma, the locus of exhumation shifted westward toward the present range front, where the rocks cooled from >200°C in the last 10–12 Myr. Our data and interpretations are consistent with a model in which the locus of faulting and exhumation shifted opposite the direction of tilt, similar to that predicted by rolling‐hinge extensional models. However, this westward shift and rapid Miocene to recent exhumation may be a local effect superimposed on lower fault displacement and exhumation rates elsewhere along the Wasatch. ;;108;mar;;;;;Armstrong_2003;American Geophysical Union ({AGU});Armstrong_2003(Journal of Geophysical Research);10.1029/2001JB001708 ;
;;;1993;;High cooling and denudation rates at Kongur Shan, Eastern Pamir (Xinjiang, China) revealed by40Ar/39Ar alkali feldspar thermochronology;;6;;;Tectonics;1335--1346;;;;;;;;;N. O. Arnaud and M. Brunel and J. M. Cantagrel and P. Tapponnier;Orthogneiss samples taken from the Kongur antiform show ages varying from 2 Ma to 1 Ma for 40Ar/39Ar ages of biotites and muscovites and fission tracks on apatites, leading to cooling rates of 150°C/m.y. Modeling of K‐feldspars highlights the effect of a range of diffusion domains with contrasting diffusion characteristics, yielding closure temperatures from 400° to 150°C. The feldspar data document the cooling history since 5 Ma and indicate a sudden change in cooling rates of the antiform at 2 Ma. At that time, cooling increases by a factor of 5, from an average of 20°C/m.y. to a minimum of 150°C/m.y. Consideration of the regional thermal history, ongoing uplift, and erosional history of the antiform during the Quaternary suggests that denudation rates have been of the order of 5–7 km/m.y. since 2 m.y. ago and could be associated with significant upward surface movement triggered by major normal faulting. The antiform is interpreted to have formed during thrusting at the Pamir front as a result of the development of thrust ramps and normal faulting at the crustal scale. Ramp stacking is an important process of mountain building, and normal faulting in this context must be regarded as a very efficient way of building high relief. ;;12;dec;;;;;Arnaud_1993;American Geophysical Union ({AGU});Arnaud_1993(Tectonics);10.1029/93TC00767;
